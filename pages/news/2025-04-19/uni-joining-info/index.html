            <h3>Intro</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                Joining the University Mario Kart League is a commitment to the future of Mario Kart e-sports in the United Kingdom, 
                and we would love to have your university represented in the league. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                The UMKL presents an exciting opportunity for students across the country to make connections 
                and have fun alongside their studies, while also providing a look into the growing competitive scene of Mario Kart.
            </p>

            <p>
                Being a part of the University Mario Kart League is a responsibility. 
                University teams are expected to maintain a level of activity throughout the season, 
                as with many teams comes a greater weight on scheduling. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Teams are also expected to act respectfully 
                and dignified to both their opponents and their peers, and we reserve the right to pull a team from the 
                league if they are acting in problematic manner.
            </p>

            <span class="settings-extra-info">Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.</span></p>
                
            <h3>Creating a New Team</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                If you are interested in creating a new team in the UMKL to represent your university, please check whether there
                are enough players at your university who are interested in participating. 
            </p>

            <p>
                A team must have a minimum of six players
                available to play in every match, so make sure there are more than enough players to fill this requirement.
                Members of your university do not need to play in matches to be part of your team.
            </p>

            <p>
                University teams should not be tied to a specific society in a university. Although specific societies in
                the university may be Mario Kart or e-sports/gaming focused, anybody in the univeristy should be free 
                to join the team regardless of their affiliation with these specific societies.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="fail">
                <b translate="no">Important</b><br>
                All efforts must be made within your university's team to include everyone, such as discussing 
                match line-ups in the UMKL server (not in a separate society's server 
                that some members may not have access to, as an example) and keeping teamwide practise to within 
                the UMKL server.<br>
                <b>This is important to keep the UMKL free and open for everyone.</b>
                <br><br>
                Promotion of the UMKL via society channels is allowed, but a distinction must be made
                about how you do not need to be part of that society to be part of the UMKL team.
                Please read the <a href="pages/rules/brand/">Brand Guidelines</a> page for more details about how you can
                use UMKL intellectual property and content. 
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Please note that current students, alumni, university faculty and prospective students (holding an offer)
                are welcome to join your team, but students outside of your university may not be allowed.
            </p>

            <blockquote class="info">
                <b translate="no">Note</b><br>
                Please visit the <a href="pages/rules/team/">Team Guidelines</a> page
                for rules associated with a new team's credentials
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Teams should thoroughly brief themselves on the <a href="pages/rules/match/">match rules</a> and relay this information to 
                their players before forming a team. The majority of our matches are livestreamed and recorded 
                for entertainment and promotion, and teams should also make their players aware of this. Players should
                be briefed on this fact and be told about the consequences of misconduct should it occur on our live matches.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Once teams have completed the above requirements, they should contact the board with 
                their request to join and we will review it. This is best done on the <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss">UMKL Discord server</a>.
                If accepted, your team will be inducted into the following season of the league. A season will 
                typically begin in October, and end in April, with matches taking a break during the winter holidays.
            </p>

            <p>
                If accepted, the board will ask your team to nominate two individuals to join 
                the board. These members will then be able to use the <code translate="no">/create-team</code> command.
            </p>
                
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="p-below-title">
                We hope that everything here is clear, and we look forward to seeing your team 
                joining the UMKL and competing in the next season. For any questions, queries or inquiries 
                contact any of the board members and we would be more than happy to help!
            </p>
