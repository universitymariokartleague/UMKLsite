        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=York">York</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=BIMM">BIMM</a></h2>

        <p>
            Our Season 1 title holders York are drawn against the oldest of newcomer teams BIMM. These teams last played 
            a test match together in <a href="pages/matches/?date=2025-06-13">June</a>, which fell in York's favour by a score of 
            <a href="pages/tools/6v6scorecalculator/?m=JoewTg1gBAagylAQgSQLKqgCgCoFMDOALlKgIaEDGAFgJRA&p=EwGgzCCsIOwgHCAjEgUKAbLBICczhUkRQAWKHFVCc6LOJABiJPAocONBot1WjiJ8TAi0w5haLtmGNR3CvWTM62RClHEeQ5UA&t=MwEQygBA0g9jAOBDCBhAlgFwJ4CgDqaANgCYR5zEDOOA4igHIQCaMlAFmqmgE4DGArphz00AOwBWyABJpiAU0QB3RLgCCotAFtEhVN1aUxAc3xpOIRGkpYufQRlOcAsnFEA3NHMUQZRtstwAITQjCEDCfjlhADYAFggAJRgsHUTEXi8VHHAyHUEjTgAFMQAjHUIcUEgQKAgAKX5RI0Iogk4UGF4YUX4MCCdyoA&n=JoewTg1gUAQgkgWQUA">516 - 468</a>. 
            Will York carry their momentum forward, or will BIMM upset the champions?
        </p>

        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Staffs">Staffs</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Glasgow">Glasgow</a></h2>

        <p>
            The runners up from Season 1 Staffs will be playing Glasgow in a chaotic first round tie. These teams 
            have met once before, back in <a href="pages/matches/?date=2025-04-27">April</a> with a victory in favour of Staffs. Can Glasgow bite back, or will 
            Staffs continue their good run of form?
        </p>

        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Brighton">Brighton</a></h2>

        <p>
            The newest addition to the UMKL roster, Brighton, will face Season 1 veterans Edinburgh 
            in their debut outing. With Edinburgh last playing back in February, Brighton could 
            certainly test the waters and snatch a hard fought result. A fun watch is definitely in 
            store with this fixture, but which team can take home the win?
        </p>

        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Keele">Keele</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Uosheff">Uosheff</a></h2>

        <p>
            Uosheff might fancy their chances against Keele, who rounded off the table in their last outing. Keele last 
            played a match in April, with a loss to their local rivals in Staffs, while Uosheff are yet to play a 
            competitive fixture. Who will come out on top in this clash of underdogs?
        </p>

        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Birmingham">Birmingham</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Liverpool">Liverpool</a></h2>

        <p>
            Our first clash of the newcomers sees Liverpool play Birmingham in a tantalising competitive debut. 
            Birmingham have chalked up impressive results in test matches recently, against <a href="pages/matches/?date=2025-08-05">Warwick</a> 
            and <a href="pages/matches/?date=2025-08-06">Cambridge</a>, 
            but can Liverpool catch them by surprise in their first ever match?
        </p>

        <h2><a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Warwick">Warwick</a> VS <a href="pages/teams/details/?team=Cambridge">Cambridge</a></h2>

        <p>
            A blockbuster tie sees Cambridge, with an upset win against York in their 
            <a href="pages/matches/?date=2025-08-29">last match</a>, 
            against a red hot Warwick side in an action packed match, where the winner takes all. 
            Which of these new teams will make their mark on an incredible first round in the new 
            season?
        </p>

        <p>Best of luck to all our teams, and may the best team win!</p>
