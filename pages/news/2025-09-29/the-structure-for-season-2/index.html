            <p>The upcoming season of UMKL will be using a Swiss Style system to determine the winner, but what exactly is that?</p>

            <p><img class="image" src="pages/news/2025-09-29/the-structure-for-season-2/season2structureupdated.avif" />
            <span class="settings-extra-info">Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.</span></p>

            <p>
                A Swiss System Tournament, most commonly used in chess, draws opponents against each other based on their 
                current standings and match records, resulting in closer matches and near accurate skill based matchmaking. 
                This simply means that teams who win will play teams who win, and teams who lose will play teams who lose; 
                there is no 'elimination' and everybody gets to keep on playing!
            </p>

            <p>
                This system allows us to reduce the number of matchdays required for each team, which helps 
                when most players are also full time students, and with the huge influx in teams this season 
                it's just not feasible nor efficient to play almost 70 matches in the space of a few months.
            </p>
                
                
            <p>With a Swiss System we reduce that number down to 24 matches, which will be closer fought and 
                more entertaining for both players and the audience.</p>

            <p>With Season 2 starting in October we hope that everyone enjoys the upcoming matches, and we look forward to seeing our teams back in action very soon!</p>
