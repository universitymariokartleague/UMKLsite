        <h2>Purpose and Overview</h2>
        <p class="p-below-title">
            The University Mario Kart League (UMKL) exists to provide a friendly and
            competitive environment for students studying at a university level in the
            United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is an independent,
            volunteer-run, non-commercial community project created by students, for
            students and run by students.<br>
        </p><br>

        <h2>Non-Affiliation and Non-Commercial</h2>
        <p class="p-below-title">
            The University Mario Kart League (UMKL) is <b>not affiliated with or endorsed
            by any university, students' union, students' society or educational
            institution.</b> We instruct our prospective teams to avoid using any name or
            branding affiliation with their respective institution of study. Participation by
            university students, alumni or faculty is <b>strictly voluntary and informal,</b> and
            should not require any external membership or fee (i.e. society membership)
            to participate in.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The University Mario Kart League is a fan-run and non-commercial
            community competition run online using Nintendo-operated online servers.
            <b>We are not affiliated with Nintendo.</b> We do not collect funds, sell
            merchandise, or seek sponsorships from corporations, educational
            institutions or charitable organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The University Mario Kart League acknowledges that Mario Kart and all
            related trademarks, game assets and logos are the property of Nintendo Co.,
            Ltd. All gameplay is used and published within the scope of fair,
            non-commercial, fan-led community engagement. <b>The UMKL does not
            claim ownership of any Nintendo intellectual property.</b>
        </p>

        <h2>Duty of Care and Safeguarding</h2>
        <p class="p-below-title">
            The University Mario Kart League is an independent student-run online
            community. Participation is voluntary and <b>outside the scope of university
            liability</b>. Competitors are encouraged to read our Code Of Conduct and may
            face removal from UMKL activities if found to be breaching our rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our Code Of Conduct, which promotes sportsmanship and inclusivity, 
            is public on our website. <b>Breaches of conduct, including harassment, hate speech, 
            or generally disruptive behaviour, will
            result in disciplinary action or removal from UMKL activities.</b> The UMKL welcomes
            competitors from all backgrounds and identities. <b>Discrimination or exclusion
            on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, disability, religion, or nationality is
            strictly not tolerated.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The University Mario Kart League is open only to individuals aged 18 or above
            who are enrolled in, or alumni/faculty of, higher educational institutions
            within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. <b>This
            ensures compliance with online safeguarding expectations and reduces
            institutional risk.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The University Mario Kart League is coordinated by a volunteer board made
            up of students and alumni from across the United Kingdom. The board
            oversees rules, moderation, and season management. Participants may
            report misconduct, breaches of conduct, or concerns regarding fairness or
            safety through the <b>UMKL Board</b> on discord directly. All reports are handled by
            neutral and non-affiliated board members, ensuring equal treatment and
            clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Protection and Privacy</h2>
        <p class="p-below-title">
            The UMKL stores <b>Discord user IDs</b> only for match organisation and point

            data controller for any information processed during competition. Any
            request to remove this information can be submitted to the <b>UMKL Board</b>
            through our Discord server.
