                If a team picks a track that has already been played and that gets chosen by the roulette, 
                they will receive a -30 point penalty. If the track was repicked via random, no penalty will be applied.
                If a random track is repicked multiple times, no penalty will be applied.

                        for example, if a team repicks twice, they will receive a -60 penalty on their second repick, 
                        for a -90 points deduction in total.
