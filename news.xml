      <description><![CDATA[<div><p>The first round of Season 2 fixtures have been revealed, and we are kicking things off in style. In the coming weeks we will see 6 matches fought between 12 universities across the UK, and all of these will be live on the UMKL YouTube channel for you to enjoy!</p><p>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eISfD64peMI">here</a> or watch the video below to see watch matches will take place in round 1!</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eISfD64peMI"></iframe><p><img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-10-01/season-2-round-1-fixtures-revealed/round2fixtures.avif"/> <i>Teams will compete in these matches in October.</i></p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=York">York</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=BIMM">BIMM</a></h2><p> Our Season 1 title holders York are drawn against the oldest of newcomer teams BIMM. These teams last played a test match together in <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/?date=2025-06-13">June</a>, which fell in York's favour by a score of <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/tools/6v6scorecalculator/?m=JoewTg1gBAagylAQgSQLKqgCgCoFMDOALlKgIaEDGAFgJRA&amp;p=EwGgzCCsIOwgHCAjEgUKAbLBICczhUkRQAWKHFVCc6LOJABiJPAocONBot1WjiJ8TAi0w5haLtmGNR3CvWTM62RClHEeQ5UA&amp;t=MwEQygBA0g9jAOBDCBhAlgFwJ4CgDqaANgCYR5zEDOOA4igHIQCaMlAFmqmgE4DGArphz00AOwBWyABJpiAU0QB3RLgCCotAFtEhVN1aUxAc3xpOIRGkpYufQRlOcAsnFEA3NHMUQZRtstwAITQjCEDCfjlhADYAFggAJRgsHUTEXi8VHHAyHUEjTgAFMQAjHUIcUEgQKAgAKX5RI0Iogk4UGF4YUX4MCCdyoA&amp;n=JoewTg1gUAQgkgWQUA">516 - 468</a>. Will York carry their momentum forward, or will BIMM upset the champions? </p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Staffs">Staffs</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Glasgow">Glasgow</a></h2><p> The runners up from Season 1 Staffs will be playing Glasgow in a chaotic first round tie. These teams have met once before, back in <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/?date=2025-04-27">April</a> with a victory in favour of Staffs. Can Glasgow bite back, or will Staffs continue their good run of form? </p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Brighton">Brighton</a></h2><p> The newest addition to the UMKL roster, Brighton, will face Season 1 veterans Edinburgh in their debut outing. With Edinburgh last playing back in February, Brighton could certainly test the waters and snatch a hard fought result. A fun watch is definitely in store with this fixture, but which team can take home the win? </p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Keele">Keele</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Uosheff">Uosheff</a></h2><p> Uosheff might fancy their chances against Keele, who rounded off the table in their last outing. Keele last played a match in April, with a loss to their local rivals in Staffs, while Uosheff are yet to play a competitive fixture. Who will come out on top in this clash of underdogs? </p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Birmingham">Birmingham</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Liverpool">Liverpool</a></h2><p> Our first clash of the newcomers sees Liverpool play Birmingham in a tantalising competitive debut. Birmingham have chalked up impressive results in test matches recently, against <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/?date=2025-08-05">Warwick</a> and <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/?date=2025-08-06">Cambridge</a>, but can Liverpool catch them by surprise in their first ever match? </p><h2><a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Warwick">Warwick</a> VS <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/teams/details/?team=Cambridge">Cambridge</a></h2><p> A blockbuster tie sees Cambridge, with an upset win against York in their <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/?date=2025-08-29">last match</a>, against a red hot Warwick side in an action packed match, where the winner takes all. Which of these new teams will make their mark on an incredible first round in the new season? </p><p>Best of luck to all our teams, and may the best team win!</p></div>]]></description>

      <title>The Structure for Season 2</title>
      <link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-09-29/the-structure-for-season-2/</link>
      <media:content url="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/news/season2structure.avif" type="image/avif" medium="image"/>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><p>The upcoming season of UMKL will be using a Swiss Style system to determine the winner, but what exactly is that?</p><p><img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-09-29/the-structure-for-season-2/season2structureupdated.avif"/> <i>Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.</i></p><p> A Swiss System Tournament, most commonly used in chess, draws opponents against each other based on their current standings and match records, resulting in closer matches and near accurate skill based matchmaking. This simply means that teams who win will play teams who win, and teams who lose will play teams who lose; there is no 'elimination' and everybody gets to keep on playing! </p><p> This system allows us to reduce the number of matchdays required for each team, which helps when most players are also full time students, and with the huge influx in teams this season it's just not feasible nor efficient to play almost 70 matches in the space of a few months. </p><p>With a Swiss System we reduce that number down to 24 matches, which will be closer fought and more entertaining for both players and the audience.</p><p>With Season 2 starting in October we hope that everyone enjoys the upcoming matches, and we look forward to seeing our teams back in action very soon!</p><p> <i> This article is an explation of an announcement made on the UMKL Discord server, you can join the server here. </i> </p></div>]]></description>

      <title>Information for universities wanting to join</title>
      <link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-04-19/uni-joining-info/</link>
      <media:content url="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/news/mariokartbanner.avif" type="image/avif" medium="image"/>
      <description><![CDATA[<div><h3>Intro</h3><p> Joining the University Mario Kart League is a commitment to the future of Mario Kart e-sports in the United Kingdom, and we would love to have your university represented in the league. </p><p> The UMKL presents an exciting opportunity for students across the country to make connections and have fun alongside their studies, while also providing a look into the growing competitive scene of Mario Kart. </p><p> Being a part of the University Mario Kart League is a responsibility. University teams are expected to maintain a level of activity throughout the season, as with many teams comes a greater weight on scheduling. </p><p> Teams are also expected to act respectfully and dignified to both their opponents and their peers, and we reserve the right to pull a team from the league if they are acting in problematic manner. </p><p><img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-04-19/uni-joining-info/mariokartbanner.avif"/> <i>Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.</i></p><h3>Creating a New Team</h3><p> If you are interested in creating a new team in the UMKL to represent your university, please check whether there are enough players at your university who are interested in participating. </p><p> A team must have a minimum of six players available to play in every match, so make sure there are more than enough players to fill this requirement. Members of your university do not need to play in matches to be part of your team. </p><p> University teams should not be tied to a specific society in a university. Although specific societies in the university may be Mario Kart or e-sports/gaming focused, anybody in the univeristy should be free to join the team regardless of their affiliation with these specific societies. </p><blockquote> <b>Important</b><br> All efforts must be made within your university's team to include everyone, such as discussing match line-ups in the UMKL server (not in a separate society's server that some members may not have access to, as an example) and keeping teamwide practise to within the UMKL server.<br> <b>This is important to keep the UMKL free and open for everyone.</b> <br><br> Promotion of the UMKL via society channels is allowed, but a distinction must be made about how you do not need to be part of that society to be part of the UMKL team. Please read the <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/brand/">Brand Guidelines</a> page for more details about how you can use UMKL intellectual property and content. </blockquote><p> Please note that current students, alumni, university faculty and prospective students (holding an offer) are welcome to join your team, but students outside of your university may not be allowed. </p><blockquote> <b>Note</b><br> Please visit the <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/team/">Team Guidelines</a> page for rules associated with a new team's credentials </blockquote><p> Teams should thoroughly brief themselves on the <a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/match/">match rules</a> and relay this information to their players before forming a team. The majority of our matches are livestreamed and recorded for entertainment and promotion, and teams should also make their players aware of this. Players should be briefed on this fact and be told about the consequences of misconduct should it occur on our live matches. </p><p> Once teams have completed the above requirements, they should contact the board with their request to join and we will review it. This is best done on the <a href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss">UMKL Discord server</a>. If accepted, your team will be inducted into the following season of the league. A season will typically begin in October, and end in April, with matches taking a break during the winter holidays. </p><p> If accepted, the board will ask your team to nominate two individuals to join the board. These members will then be able to use the <code>/create-team</code> command. </p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> We hope that everything here is clear, and we look forward to seeing your team joining the UMKL and competing in the next season. For any questions, queries or inquiries contact any of the board members and we would be more than happy to help! </p><p> You can join our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss">here</a> and find our YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@universitymariokartleague">here</a>. </p></div>]]></description>
