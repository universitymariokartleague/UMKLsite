			<title>The Structure for Season 2</title>
			<link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-09-29/the-structure-for-season-2/</link>

			<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming season of UMKL will be using a Swiss Style system to determine the winner, but what exactly is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-09-29/the-structure-for-season-2/season2structureupdated.avif"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                A Swiss System Tournament, most commonly used in chess, draws opponents against each other based on their 
                current standings and match records, resulting in closer matches and near accurate skill based matchmaking. 
                This simply means that teams who win will play teams who win, and teams who lose will play teams who lose; 
                there is no 'elimination' and everybody gets to keep on playing!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                This system allows us to reduce the number of matchdays required for each team, which helps 
                when most players are also full time students, and with the huge influx in teams this season 
                it's just not feasible nor efficient to play almost 70 matches in the space of a few months.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a Swiss System we reduce that number down to 24 matches, which will be closer fought and 
                more entertaining for both players and the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Season 2 starting in October we hope that everyone enjoys the upcoming matches, and we look forward to seeing our teams back in action very soon!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;

			<title>Cheep Cheep Updates</title>
			<link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-07-17/cheep-cheep-updates/</link>
			<media:content url="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/news/newcommands.avif" type="image/avif" medium="image"> </media:content>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all! Here are a few updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                It's been a few months since the announcement of 
                &lt;mention&gt;@Cheep Cheep&lt;/mention&gt; app, 
                since then a lot of new commands and features have been added.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Work is being done constantly to improve the stability of our 
                systems we use for UMKL, so we hope everyone is happy with the 
                continued development!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important change from the 
                previous message is that the &lt;code&gt;/register&lt;/code&gt; has been removed, as 
                it is no longer required to use &lt;code&gt;/join&lt;/code&gt; when you're joining a 
                team. A full changelog will be listed at the end of this page.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                A few test matches have occurred recently and they've gone smoothly, 
                so more test matches will follow! 
                So be sure to check the &lt;a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/matches/"&gt;matches&lt;/a&gt; page
                for upcoming matches!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are some newly added commands that can be used in the server!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-07-17/cheep-cheep-updates/newcommands.png"&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Changelog for the 17/07/2025 update&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/register&lt;/code&gt; removed, it is no longer required to use &lt;code&gt;/join&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New command - &lt;code&gt;/leaderboards&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatted &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;DD/MM/YYYY&lt;/code&gt; in embeds (only for outputted text, not for command inputs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the match versus image on the sign-up embed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed the date in the sign-up embed to a timestamp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New command - &lt;code&gt;/change-team-colour&lt;/code&gt; (board only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal changes to SQL/DB threading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internal changes to the API used on &lt;code&gt;umkl.co.uk&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweaked graphics to add shadowing beneath text to improve contrast and readability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New command - &lt;code&gt;/generate-stream-overlay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed &lt;code&gt;/team-profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New commands (used for streaming overlay):
                        &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/add-results-to-liveresults&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/edit-results-in-liveresults&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/reset-liveresults&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New command - &lt;code&gt;/submit-room-code&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New command - &lt;code&gt;/report-disconnection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added some easter eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;

			<title>Information for universities wanting to join</title>
			<link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-04-19/uni-joining-info/</link>
			<media:content url="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/news/mariokartbanner.avif" type="image/avif" medium="image"> </media:content>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Intro&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Joining the University Mario Kart League is a commitment to the future of Mario Kart e-sports in the United Kingdom, 
                and we would love to have your university represented in the league. 
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                The UMKL presents an exciting opportunity for students across the country to make connections 
                and have fun alongside their studies, while also providing a look into the growing competitive scene of Mario Kart.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Being a part of the University Mario Kart League is a responsibility. 
                University teams are expected to maintain a level of activity throughout the season, 
                as with many teams comes a greater weight on scheduling. 
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Teams are also expected to act respectfully 
                and dignified to both their opponents and their peers, and we reserve the right to pull a team from the 
                league if they are acting in problematic manner.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-04-19/uni-joining-info/mariokartbanner.avif"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Creating a New Team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                If you are interested in creating a new team in the UMKL to represent your university, please check whether there
                are enough players at your university who are interested in participating. 
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                A team must have a minimum of six players
                available to play in every match, so make sure there are more than enough players to fill this requirement.
                Members of your university do not need to play in matches to be part of your team.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                University teams should not be tied to a specific society in a university. Although specific societies in
                the university may be Mario Kart or e-sports/gaming focused, anybody in the univeristy should be free 
                to join the team regardless of their affiliation with these specific societies.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Important&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                All efforts must be made within your university's team to include everyone, such as discussing 
                match line-ups in the UMKL server (not in a separate society's server 
                that some members may not have access to, as an example) and keeping teamwide practise to within 
                the UMKL server.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This is important to keep the UMKL free and open for everyone.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                Promotion of the UMKL via society channels is allowed, but a distinction must be made
                about how you do not need to be part of that society to be part of the UMKL team.
                Please read the &lt;a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/brand/"&gt;Brand Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; page for more details about how you can
                use UMKL intellectual property and content. 
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Please note that current students, alumni, university faculty and prospective students (holding an offer)
                are welcome to join your team, but students outside of your university may not be allowed.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
                Please visit the &lt;a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/team/"&gt;Team Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; page
                for rules associated with a new team's credentials
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Teams should thoroughly brief themselves on the &lt;a href="https://umkl.co.uk/pages/rules/match/"&gt;match rules&lt;/a&gt; and relay this information to 
                their players before forming a team. The majority of our matches are livestreamed and recorded 
                for entertainment and promotion, and teams should also make their players aware of this. Players should
                be briefed on this fact and be told about the consequences of misconduct should it occur on our live matches.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                Once teams have completed the above requirements, they should contact the board with 
                their request to join and we will review it. This is best done on the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss"&gt;UMKL Discord server&lt;/a&gt;.
                If accepted, your team will be inducted into the following season of the league. A season will 
                typically begin in October, and end in April, with matches taking a break during the winter holidays.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                If accepted, the board will ask your team to nominate two individuals to join 
                the board. These members will then be able to use the &lt;code&gt;/create-team&lt;/code&gt; command.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                We hope that everything here is clear, and we look forward to seeing your team 
                joining the UMKL and competing in the next season. For any questions, queries or inquiries 
                contact any of the board members and we would be more than happy to help!
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                You can join our Discord server &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;

			<title>Welcome to the UMKL!</title>
			<link>https://umkl.co.uk/pages/news/2025-04-19/umkl-intro</link>
			<media:content url="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/news/umklbanner.avif" type="image/avif" medium="image"> </media:content>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the University Mario Kart League!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've reached this page, you probably have an idea of what we do, but we'll explain more below!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                We're an independent gaming league made up of university teams across the country,
                which compete in 6v6 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe matches.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
                This project started last year, where we had four university teams in play, 
                but this has quickly expanded to universities across the country! Currently 
                we're still growing, with 6v6 test matches and friendlies being played until our 
                next season starts next academic year.
            &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://umkl.co.uk/assets/media/brand/UMKL_Season_2_Teaser.avif"&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Season 2 is scheduled to start in October 2025.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're one season down, with our reigning champions York topping the charts for Season 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some team logos were incomplete during Season 1.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
                Currently, whilst we're working on our website and the next season's roster, we are currently 
                having on-going test matches between our teams and practice rooms.
            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
                The UMKL discord is growing daily, with more and more interest being shown in our matches and livestreams,
                as we carve out our own little niche in gaming culture.
            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
                We are run by students, for students, and remain dedicated 
                to forging connections between universities. Our 6v6 comp format gives uni groups 
                ample opportunity to communicate with each other, 
                improve their Mario Kart 8 Deluxe skills, and grow as a team together. 
            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; 
                With 12 players and 12 races per match, get ready to 
                practice your green shell snipes, bomb throws,
                and to communicate effectively as a team to speed towards victory!
            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
                You can join our Discord server &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/jz3hKEmDss"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
                Our YouTube channel, where we livestream matches, can be visited &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@universitymariokartleague"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
